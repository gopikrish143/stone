As a cinematographer, my passion is to capture moments and tell stories through the lens of a camera. I have experience in a range of projects, including short films, documentaries, and commercials. My portfolio features a variety of work that showcases my skills in lighting, framing, and visual storytelling. Whether it's creating moody atmospheres or capturing the beauty of natural light, I strive to create compelling visuals that immerse the audience in the story. With my technical expertise in camera operation, lighting, and color grading, I aim to bring a unique perspective to every project. I am dedicated to collaborating with directors, producers, and other creatives to achieve their vision and create memorable cinematic experiences.
